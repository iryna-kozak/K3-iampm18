There are some points to clarify with you:

1.  The team develops 3 types of accounts :  
- students (beginner clients)
- traders 
- admin (for managing user functionality).

2. Different types of users may have different functionality. 
3. The difference in functionality for various user types is in their ability to use AI - and scripting.
4. The team  developes the ability for admin to share custom templates and basic features with clients (indidvidually and in groups).
